# MIDI files

These are the MIDI files of some of my favorite songs I'm using to experiment with a [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) project. I _borrowed_ these from the YouTube channels that provided free MIDI files. I do not own any of them. With that said, here is the list of sources where these files were collected from.
